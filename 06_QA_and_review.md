# Quality assurance in annotation: precision, agreement, feedback loops  
*A practical system for validating, refining, and scaling annotation quality*

---

### 🌟 Why this block matters

A great taxonomy is useless if it’s applied inconsistently.
LLMs are hypersensitive to data noise.

This block helps QA teams:
- Catch inconsistencies and silent logic errors
- Improve inter-annotator agreement
- Build feedback loops without shaming
- Systematize reviewer-on-reviewer alignment

### ⚖️ What to review

| Layer                    | Focus area                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Label choice            | Is the tag correct, specific, and model-visible?            |
| Edge-case handling      | Was ambiguity handled explicitly (e.g. flagged)?            |
| Annotation structure    | Are chunks clean, scoped, not overwritten or rewritten?     |
| Reviewer notes          | Do they explain reasoning or just say "unclear"?            |

### 🤔 Common QA anti-patterns

- ✅ Correct tag, ❌ vague note → reviewer becomes a bottleneck
- ❌ Over-editing → destroys chunk boundaries and token anchors
- ❌ “Fixing tone” instead of aligning with model interpretation
- ❌ Flag avoidance → silent propagation of ambiguity downstream

### ♻️ QA loop structure

1. **First pass** — factual accuracy, correct labels, basic formatting
2. **Second pass** — edge-case flags, token alignment, re-check context window
3. **Micro-retros** — reviewers tag confusing decisions for team analysis
4. **Reviewer-on-reviewer sampling** — spot check QA consistency

### ✅ QA-ready checklist

- [ ] Does this annotation teach the model what we want it to learn?  
- [ ] Can another annotator follow the decision process?
- [ ] Did we preserve interpretation logic, not rewrite intent?
- [ ] Did we resolve ambiguity *without* hiding it?
