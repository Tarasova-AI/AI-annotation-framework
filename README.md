# ai-annotation-framework
A UX-first, model-aware annotation framework for training LLMs
# AI-ready Annotation Framework  
*A UX-first system for reliable, multilingual, and model-aligned annotation*

## 🎯 What is this?

This is a modular, reusable annotation framework built for AI teams working with large language models (LLMs).  
It teaches annotators and designers to shift from “editing text” to **designing what the model sees and learns**.

---

## 🧠 Why it matters

Most annotation mistakes are not about the wrong label —  
they're about the wrong mental model of how LLMs interpret input.

This framework helps teams:

- ✅ Reduce hallucinations and logic loss  
- ✅ Handle multilingual token differences  
- ✅ Train annotators to think like the model  
- ✅ Scale QA and onboarding with reusable blocks

## 👥 Who it’s for

- Annotation teams working with LLMs  
- Multilingual data labeling workflows  
- UX/content experts supporting AI products  
- Engineers and reviewers managing fine-tuning pipelines
