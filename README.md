# AI-ready annotation framework  
*A modular, UX-oriented system for training reliable and interpretable LLMs*

---

## üéØ What is this?

This is a full-stack annotation framework for teams building or managing high-quality datasets for LLMs.  
It brings together annotation strategy, UX design, multilingual workflows, quality control, and prompt-assisted automation.

You can use it as:

- A training system for annotators and reviewers  
- A reference architecture for annotation pipeline design  
- A portfolio-ready showcase of scalable, human-in-the-loop data thinking

## üß† Why it matters

Most annotation guidelines focus on surface tags.  
This framework focuses on what matters to the model:

- Token alignment  
- Interpretability under context windows  
- Cultural ambiguity  
- Model-visible structures  
- Sustainable review and QA loops

## üì¶ Framework structure

The framework is modular. Each block can stand alone ‚Äî but together, they form a complete pipeline.
